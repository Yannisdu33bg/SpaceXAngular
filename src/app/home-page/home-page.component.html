      The Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX) is an American
      spacecraft manufacturer, launcher, and satellite communications company
      headquartered in Hawthorne, California. The company was founded in 2002 by
      Elon Musk with the goal of reducing space transportation costs and to
      colonize Mars. The company manufactures the Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and
      Starship heavy-lift launch vehicles, the Cargo Dragon and Crew Dragon
      spacecrafts, the Starlink mega-constellation satellite and rocket engines.
      SpaceX offers commercial satellite-based internet service via its
      constellation of Starlink satellites, which became the largest-ever
      satellite constellation in January 2020 and as of June 2023 comprised more
      than 4,300 small satellites in orbit. The company is also developing
      Starship, a fully reusable, super heavy-lift launch system for
      interplanetary and orbital spaceflight. On its failed first flight in
      April 2023, it became the largest and most powerful rocket ever flown.
      Starship is intended to become SpaceX's primary orbital vehicle,
      supplanting the existing Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Dragon fleet. SpaceX
      is the first private company to develop a liquid-propellant rocket that
      has reached orbit; to launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft; to send a
      spacecraft to the International Space Station; and to send astronauts to
      the International Space Station. It is also the first organization of any
      type to achieve a vertical propulsive landing of an orbital rocket booster
      and the first to reuse such a booster. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets have
      landed and reflown more than 170 times.
